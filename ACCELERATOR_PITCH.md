# ClimateGuard Nigeria - Accelerator Application

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**90% of Nigerian farmers rely on rainfed agriculture but receive forecasts that are:**
- Too broad (state-level instead of farm-level)
- Too late (after planting decisions are made)
- Unreliable (low trust in NiMet forecasts)

**Result**: Billions in losses annually from:
- Wrong planting times
- Crop failures
- Flood/drought disasters
- Livestock losses
- Security incidents

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**ClimateGuard Nigeria** is a hyperlocal climate intelligence platform delivering:

1. **Location-Specific Forecasts** (down to 5km radius)
2. **Prescriptive Action Guides** (when to plant, irrigate, harvest)
3. **Multi-Hazard Alerts** (weather, disease, security)
4. **Multi-Channel Delivery** (web, mobile, SMS)

### Key Differentiators
- **Hyperlocal**: Farm-level precision vs state-level forecasts
- **Actionable**: "Plant tomorrow" vs "Rain expected this week"
- **Integrated**: Weather + Disease + Security in one platform
- **Accessible**: SMS for feature phones, web for smartphones
